<h3>Goal :</h3>
The application aims to teach autistic children how to perform daily tasks (such as brushing their teeth ..). The child's parent or therapist is responsible for setting up their child's account. He can then create daily tasks (including a picture, video and steps) and assign them to the child assigned to him. He can access the child's progress (number of times the child has performed the task, the number of times he has seen the descriptive video of the task, etc.).
Finally, the child can also play memory with images which are also based on daily tasks.
